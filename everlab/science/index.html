    <h2>The science behind The Radiological Accident in Goi√¢nian</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This Radiological Accident was caused by a caesium-137 radio-therepy unit. Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope of the element caesium. Caesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years, meaning on average after 30 years, half of the caesium would have decayed into barium-137m. This isotope of caesium decays via beta decay. The caesium-137 in the form of caesium chloride, and a deep blue light was emitted off of the powder. It is unknown why the powder glowed, but is thought to be Cherenkov radiation, which is caused by electrons moving faster than light. This effect is very weak in air but much stronger in water as the speed of light is slower.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>The Numbers</h4>
    <p>Ultimately, 250 people were found to be contaminated. 20 of these 250 required treatment. There were four fatalities: two employees of the first scrapyard owner, the scrapyard owner's wife, and the scrapyard owner's niece who had eaten the sandwich. They all got doses of radiation estimated to be around 4.5-6 Gy. With care, the mortality rate is anywhere from 5% to 50%. The first scrapyard owner recieved an estimated 7 Gy of radiation, usually a fatal dose, but didn't die until 1994.</p>
