<h1>Cryptocurrencies</h1>
<br>
<p>For a bit over than a year, I have been very active in the crypto-currency community. I am currently running a Sia node, an Ethereum node, and a Monero Node. I have created my own cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum ERC-20 token protocall, and have made over $200 from nothing by using my computer's processing power to mine for these cryptocurrencies. Nodes help keep the network secure, and require command line usage.</p>
<h4>The cryptocurrency projects which I am involved in:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Monero

  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>It's ticker is XMR</li>
    <li>Monero is the biggest privacy based Cryptocurrency. It is so secure that they are currently looking into post quantum-computing measures to be secure in an era where almost nothing is secure.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Basic Attention Token

  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>It's ticker is BAT</li>
    <li>BAT is a cryptocurrency that is trying to disrupt the whole ad industry. Once implemented, it will pay users of their browser called Brave in BAT for their "Attention." Ad companies will be able to target their ads much better, and users will be paid to view these ads. Its a win-win for comsumers and companies alike!</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>The reason why I like cryptocurrencies so much is because I think that they are the future. They, and the technologies behind them has so many potential use cases, such as in advertising (BAT), data security and backup (SIA), banking (OMG and XRP), and so much more.</h4>
