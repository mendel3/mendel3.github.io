<h1>Cryptocurrencies</h1>
<br>
<p>For a bit over than a year, I have been very active in the crypto-currency community. I am currently running a Sia node, an Ethereum node, and a Monero Node. I have created my own cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum ERC-20 token protocall, and have made over $200 from nothing by using my computer's processing power to mine for these cryptocurrencies.</p>
